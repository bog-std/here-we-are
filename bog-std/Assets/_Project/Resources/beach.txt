:=:J:beach_jordan_annoyed
:?:Jordan: Totally. Love the feeling of hot sand and blistering heat.
	But you have friends
	I’m just happy to be here:Invited
:D:Player:At least you’re here with friends.
:D:Jordan: I said we should take a road trip to San Fran, and instead I get brought here.
:D:Player: The beach was the majority vote.

:>:Continue

Invited:D:Player: I’m not really one for beaches either. I’m just happy to be invited.
:D:Jordan: You voted to go to the beach!
:D:Player: Because I also didn’t want to sit in a stuffy car for several days. Not there’s anything wrong with that, I just have a weak bladder.
:D:Jordan: Riiiight.

Continue:D:Player: You know where the twins went?
:D:Jordan: I think they’re off getting ice cream. 
:=:J:beach_jordan_neutral
:D:Player: We don’t have any in the cooler?
:D:Jordan: It’s a cooler, not a portable freezer.
:?:Player: But it’s insulated no?
	Offer Jordan something cold
	Search for booze:Cider

:D:Player: You want something?
:D:Jordan: We packed some juice, right? Pass me one.

Cider:D:Player: Ooooh…
:D:Jordan: What?
:D:Player: Someone packed ciders.

:?:Jordan: We’re at a public beach! You can’t drink here.
	Drink the Cider
	Drink Juice:Juice
	Take Nothing:Nothing
:D:Player: Sorry, but I couldn't resist.

Juice:?:Jordan: Can you give me a juice at least?

Nothing:D:: You return to your previous spot, sad that you didn’t find any ice cream. sad

Continue:D:Scott: Told you we’d find them here.

:=:2:icecream_sarah_giggle
:?:Sarah: You guys picked a great spot. 
	Notice cones in hand.
:D:Player:Did you buy us some ice cream?
:D:Scott: Sure did. Two vanilla cones with extra sprinkles for you two.
:D:Sarah: Although we can always eat everything on our own if you don’t ask nicely.
:=:2:icecream_sarah_neutral
:?:Jordan: Ask nicely.[wait 1] For me?
	Ask Nicely
	Demand :Demand
:D:Player: Would you kindly bestow unto us the iced creams?
:D:Sarah: Oh my. Scott, I think we have a genuine gentleman on our hands.
:=:2:icecream_sarah_giggle
:D:Scott: Here you go, sir. Two vanilla cones, with plenty of sprinkles.

:+:R:3

Demand:D:Player: Would you just hand them over? Else it’ll melt in your hands.
:=:1:icecream_scott_meh
:D:Scott: Yeah, whatever. Here ya go. Plenty of sprinkles that you don’t deserve.
:=:J:icecream_jordan_anger
:D:Scott:That was a joke.

Continue:=:1:icecream_scott_meh
:D:Scott: We sure picked a hell of a time to come to the beach, didn’t we?
:D:Player: I’m just glad we got here before the afternoon. Place started crowding up as soon as we put up the umbrella. 
:D:Jordan: You should’ve stuck around to see it. A near empty beach, and then BAM! Filled up in the blink of an eye. 
:=:J:icecream_jordan_neutral
:=:2:icecream_sarah_neutral
:D:Sarah: Well it is beach season. Perfect weather to hit the waves too. I’d be surprised if the beach was empty. 
:=:1:icecream_scott_neutral
:D:Scott: Speaking of which, wanna hit the waves?
:D:Jordan: I don’t see why not. 
:D:Sarah: Just watch for the rip tide and don’t get pulled out to sea. 
:D:Scott: There wasn’t a sign up, so I don’t think that’ll be a problem.
:D:Player: Let’s finish our ice creams first before we do anything. What’re our plans for tonight?
:D:Jordan: I hear they put on a firework show every Friday from the boardwalk. We can swing by after dinner and watch.
:D:Scott: Sounds like a plan to me.
:=:1:icecream_scott_cocky
:D:Scott:Last one in the water’s paying for dinner!
:=:1:beach_scott_cocky
:D:: We spent the day at that beach. From noon till night, we were either in the water or in the sun, and I can’t remember a day better than that.
:D:: I think Scott was the only idiot amongst us who went for a tan without sunscreen, and ended up turning into a sunburnt tomato.
:D:: Crispy on the outside, yet full to bursting on the inside.Once the sun started to set, we grabbed food, waiting patiently for the fireworks to mark the day’s end.

:D:Player: What’s with the salad?
:D:Sarah: Gotta watch my figure. A body like this takes work.
:?:Scott: That’s not what you said when you ate a pint of ice cream all by yourself.
	A whole pint?
	Watch your mouth.:Crispy

:D:Player: Wait you had a whole pint to yourself?
:D:Scott: Oh yeah. Caught her in the kitchen after she came home late. Shovelled that pint in her face with a spoon like madman. 
:D:Sarah: You ought to learn to shut your trap, brother. 
:D:Jordan: What flavour?
:D:Sarah: Rocky road. Took me ages to work off those calories.
:+:r:1

Crispy:D:Player: I’d be careful what I’d say Mr. Crispy
:D:Scott: Hey don’t give the devil more ammo!
:D:Sarah: You ought to learn to shut your trap, brother. 
:D:Jordan: You’re right about that girl. Boys just never know when to stop talking.
:D:Scott: I’m right here you know. 
:D:Player: I think it’s less about boys, and just about you man. Know when you’re beat. 
:+:R:1

Continue:D:Player: So, you know when that fireworks show is supposed to start? 
:D:Jordan: Sometime around 10, I think?
:D:Player: You think? 
:D:Jordan: I just heard they do a show on Fridays. I didn’t get a timetable or anything from anybody. 
:D:Sarah: But it hasn’t happened yet right? Then we’ll just take a walk after dinner and see if we can catch it. 
:D:Jordan: I knew there was a reason I loved you the most between you and Scott.
:D:Sarah: Oh, I love you too girl. 
:D:Scott: What about us?
:D:Jordan: Well I love you both too. Just love Sarah more.
:D:Sarah: Help me take some pictures Jordan!
:D:Jordan: So you can brag to your Instagram followers?
:D:Sarah: What else?

:D:Scott: What do you think about Jordan?
:D:Player: What do you mean by that?
:D:Scott: She’s cute don’t you think? I heard she turns down guys left, right and center, and that her standards are super high. That’s what Sarah tells me anyways. 
:D:Player: What exactly are you getting at?
:?:Scott: I’m thinking of asking her out. 
	Seriously?
	Go for it.:Support

:D:Player: 	You sure you want to do that?
:D:Scott: I’m pretty sure.
:D:Player: On a scale of 1 to 10, how sure are you? With 1 being “really unsure”, and 10 being you “know for certain”?
:D:Scott: .[wait 1].[wait 1].
:D:Player: Scott?
:+:r:1
:?:Scott: I don’t know. Probably a 7.5, or an 8?
	Are you sure?
	Believe me.:Shattered

:D:Player: 	Sounds pretty high. You really want to go for it?
:D:Scott: Yeah.
:+:r:1
:?:Scott: “Shoot your shot” right?
	Why not?
	Umm…:Idea

:D:Player: I mean, you could.
:+:R:1

Idea:D:Player: Probably not the best idea. 
:D:Scott: Why not?
:D:Player: Just trust me, when I say, it’s probably not the best idea.
:+:r:1
:>:Continue

Shattered:D:Player: That’s a big score. But I hate to break it to you, your heart’s gonna get shattered. 
:D:Scott: … 
:+:R:1
:?:Scott: How do you know that?
	What makes you so special?	
	She’s mine.:Together

:D:Player: Like you said, she’s turned down a bunch of guys already. What do you have that they don’t?
:D:Scott: I-
:D:Player: It ain’t money. It certainly isn’t charisma.
:D:Scott: I can make her laugh though.
:D:Player: Yeah, but is a fish able to breathe in water? 
:D:Scott: … Point taken.
:+:R:1
:>:Continue

Together:D:Player: Because she and I are already together. 
:D:Scott: You are? Uh, forget I said anything then.
:+:r:3
:>:Continue

Support:D:Player: I’d support you. 
:D:Scott: What?
:?:Scott: Really?
	Might as well.
	Bruh!:Ask

:D:Player: 	Yeah, why not? Like you said, you never know until you try, and what’s the worse she could say?
:D:Scott: Probably ‘no’. 
:D:Player: Probably?
:D:Scott: Probably. 
:+:R:2
:>:Continue

Ask:D:Player: No! Dude, imagine me asking out Sarah. How would you feel about that?
:D:Scott: I mean I’d be fine with it.
:D:Player: Okay, sure. But then what if you break up? What if something stupid happens and your relationship just falls apart?
:D:Player: I know I’m not supposed to be saying this to you, but if I don’t now, then you’ll be asking yourself later. Or worse, Jordan asks you. 
:D:Scott: .[wait 1].[wait 1].
:D:Scott: Fuck.
:D:Player: Right? I don’t think either of us want to not be friends. For the sake of the friendship between all of us, bad idea.

:D:Sarah: It’s beautiful isn’t it?
:D:Player: Beautiful enough to put on Instagram four hundred times? 
:D:Sarah: Better than that. Not as pretty as you though.
:D:Player: Aww thanks Sarah.
:D:Jordan: What about me?
:D:Scott: I think you’re pretty.
:D:Jordan: You’d think a rock could be pretty if it talked to you first.
:D:Scott: Damn, that’s cold.
:D:Player: Forget roasting him Jo. You just immolated him.
:D:Scott: Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.
:D:Scott: it’s fine.
:D:Scott: It’s like when you have to melt the sugar on crème brulee. Just better in every way. 
:D:Jordan: You know I’m not a big fan of sweets Scotty boy. 
:D:: .[wait 1].[Wait 1].
:D:Player: This is nice, isn’t it?
:D:All: Oh yeah. Yeah.
:D:Player: Times like this I forget life isn’t all about cramming for exams.
:?:Jordan: Certainly feels like that though.
	It’s almost over
	Agree with Scott:Present

:D:Player: Only a few years left though. 
:D:Sarah: Got a long way to go that’s for sure. But we’ll make it. 
:D:Jordan: It just feels so daunting, know what I mean? When we’re done, that piece of paper will decide how we’ll live for the rest of our lives.
:D:Scott: We’re young. That’s what matters. We can afford a few mistakes here and there. As long as we’re alive, that’s all that matters.
:+:E:1
:>:Continue

Present:D:Player: The present is the only thing that matters
:D:Scott: Yeah. Just live for the moment.
:D:Jordan: Isn’t that an irresponsible way to think? 
:D:Player: Only if you want it to be. 
:D:Jordan: You know that’s not what I’m asking.
:D:Sarah: They’re right though Jordan. The present is always a surprise.
:D:Sarah: That’s why it’s called the present.
:D:Sarah: Right now, we’re four friends on a great stretch of summer vacation, having the time of our lives before the next school year happens.
:D:Sarah: And until then, we should be allowed to have as much fun as we want.
:D:Player: Amen to that.
