:D:Jordan: I was wondering when you’d get here.
:D:Player: Took some time to smell the flowers on the way. Did you see the pagoda on the way in?
:D:Jordan: I think they had that same one on the other end of the garden last year. Still pretty though.
:D:Player: That we can agree on. So what happened? You okay?
:=:J:garden_sad_smile
:?:Jordan: Yeah, I’m fine. Just wanted to enjoy a day at the gardens with a friend. Is that not allowed?
	It’s not the strangest thing I’ve been asked to do.
	The invitation was sort of out of the blue.:invitation

:D:Jordan: Well I’m glad you came out and joined me. 
:D:Player: I didn’t even know about this garden until you told me to come out here.
:=:J:garden_neutral
:D:Jordan: It’s pretty, isn’t it?
:+:R:1
:>:Continue

invitation:D:Jordan: It was, wasn’t it?
:=:J:garden_sad_smile
:D:Player: I’m just not the type to want to go out and do something suddenly. I like plans, even if it was a day in advance.
:=:J:garden_annoyed
:D:Jordan: You don’t need to make excuses. It’s all right. I’m just glad you’re here now.
:+:r:1

Continue:D:Jordan: It gets lonely being at a botanical garden by yourself y’know. It’s nice to have company every once in a while.
:=:J:garden_empty
:D:Player: I bet you say that to all the guys. 
:=:J:garden_sad_smile
:?:Jordan: Just the ones I like. 
	You want to go into that more?
	What’s really going on Jordan?:Really

:=:J:garden_empty
:?:Jordan: What’s there to say? 
	Care to elaborate?
	Never mind.:Nevermind

:=:J:garden_neutral
:D:Player: It just sounds like there’s something you’re trying to say but you won’t say it
:D:Jordan: Ah, forget it. It sounds like we’re in some poorly constructed visual novel or something.
:D:Player: You said it, not me.
:+:r:1
:>:Continue

Really:D:Jordan: What’re you talking about?
:=:J:garden_neutral
:D:Player: You asked me to come out here. Why?
:?:Jordan: I told you why. 
	I’m just not convinced is all.
	You know you can talk to me, right?:Talk

:D:Player: You’ve never invited someone out the day of and several hours before the meeting.
:D:Jordan: I can’t just jump into it suddenly. At least let me be comfortable.
:=:J:garden_sad_smile
:D:Player: All right. Just, talk to me, okay? 
:+:re:1
:>:Continue

Talk:D::Player: I’m just worried you’re trying to hide something and don’t want to talk about it.
:D:Jordan: Well it’s not like that. Really.
:=:J:garden_annoyed
:D:Player: Just, remember I’m here for you. If you want to talk, just talk. 
:+:RE:1
:>:Continue

Nevermind:D:Player: I thought you were trying to say something else but I got what you mean.
:D:Jordan: Thanks. I’m glad you at least know me enough to understand me.
:=:J:garden_sad_smile
:D:Player: I’d be a shame to not after all these years.
:+:R:1

Continue:D:Jordan: I always love it out here.
:=:J:garden_empty
:?:Jordan: It’s so…
	Quiet?
	Peaceful?
	Boring?

:=:J:garden_neutral
:D:Jordan: I was going to say serene. It’s just a place that’s easy for me to relax in. 
:D:Player: I can see that. It really is peaceful.
:D:Jordan: It’s hard to unwind anywhere else. 
:D:Player: Not even at home?
:=:J:garden_anxious
:?:Jordan: Not even at home. Dad’s gotten sick, and home just sounds like his respirator.
	What do you mean?
	What happened?:What

:D:Player: What do you mean “sick”? He was fine last time I saw him.
:D:Jordan: That’s the thing. The doctors don’t know what it is either. 
:D:Player: That’s awful.
:+:G:2
:=:J:garden_angry
:?:Jordan: And the best part? They’re making me isolate from him because they don’t know where he got infected from.
	What?!
	It’s more for you than him.:More

:D:Player: That’s really stupid. You’re his daughter, there’s no way you’d be the one to infect him.	
:=:J:garden_angry
:D:Jordan: I know right? Like, I didn’t go anywhere infectious, so I don’t have the first clue as to where he picked it up from.
:D:Player: Shouldn’t the doctors be more worried about how to treat him?
:D:Jordan: They are. They’re working on it.
:=:J:garden_anxious
:+:R:1
:+:g:2
:>:Continue

What:D:Player: What’s wrong with him?
:+:G:1
:=:J:garden_anxious
:?:Jordan: Don’t know. He’s infected with something, but the doctors don’t know, and he’s looking worse by the day. 
	Are you okay?
	Will you be okay?:Will

:D:Player: You doing all right?
:=:J:garden_empty
:D:Jordan: Yeah? No. I don’t know. 
:+:RE:2

Will:D:Player: I’m sure your dad will get better.
:=:J:garden_sad_smile
:D:Jordan: Eventually, yeah. 
:+:GE:2
:>:Continue

More:D:Player: I’m sure they’re only thinking about your safety when they say that.
:=:J:garden_angry
:D:Jordan: MY safety?
:D:Player: What if you catch whatever your father has? 
:D:Jordan: I can’t leave my father like that.
:D:Player: Then who’s going to take care of you? Me? Your dad?
:+:R:1
:+:G:2

Continue:D:Player: Besides your dad getting sick, how’s he been doing? I know having to raise you was a tough job in and of itself.
:=:J:garden_annoyed
:?:Jordan: He got himself a girlfriend.
	Sly old dog!

:D:Player: Good for him! Is she a keeper?
:D:Jordan: She sure seems to think so. 
:D:Player: Is she really that bad? 
:+:r:1
:+:e:2
:?:Jordan: She’s like a leech, or a tapeworm. I keep trying to tell him, but he just doesn’t see it.
	No one deserves to be called a parasite Jordan.
	If she’s as bad as you say, she really should leave.:Leave

:=:J:garden_neutral
:D:Jordan: Some people do.
:D:Player: I don’t-
:+:E:2
:=:J:garden_annoyed
:?:Jordan: Especially if they start splitting your household and alienate your father.
	You’re imagining things.
	People are the worst.:Worst

:D:Player: There’s no way anyone intentionally decides to do something like that.
:D:Jordan: You let yourself be naïve like that and tragedy will strike you soon I swear. People are evil creatures. Behind every nice smelling perfume and pearly white smiles, is a soul as evil as they come. 
:=:J:garden_neutral
:D:Player: Not all people are like that. Look at us, or Scott or Sarah. We’re not evil.
:+:E:2
:>:Continue

Worst:D:Player: I can’t say I disagree with that statement though. No one likes a homewrecker.
:=:J:garden_angry
:D:Jordan: Exactly! I wish she’d never come into our lives. 
:D:Player: What does she try to do usually? 
:=:J:garden_annoyed
:D:Jordan: Picks out things to argue about, or makes comments on the way I dress and act. 
:+:r:2
:+:E:1
:>:Continue

Leave:D:Jordan: Thank you.
:=:J:garden_angry
:D:Jordan: Finally, someone gets it. 
:D:Player: Granted, I don’t know anything about her, other than what you’re saying. 
:+:R:1
:+:e:2
:?:Jordan: I’m not one to lie about this kind of thing.
	I would hope not.
	I believe you.:Believe

:D:Player: If you are, I’d be incredibly disappointed.
:+:r:1
:>:Continue

Believe:D:Player: I know you wouldn’t. It’d be a scummy thing to do.
:+:R:1

Continue:D:Jordan: Worst thing is, is she’s trying to prevent me from even being in contact with my dad. 
:=:J:garden_neutral
:D:Player: WHAT?!
:D:Jordan: Shitty, right?
:=:J:garden_sad_smile
:D:Player: How is she even getting away with that?
:=:J:garden_anxious
:D:Jordan: I’m not home a lot, and she’s used that as an excuse to further distance the two of us. 
:D:Player: I can see how that would work as an excuse. 
:?:Jordan: What if he dies and I can’t see him anymore? 
	Don’t think like that!
	It’ll be alright:Alright

:D:Player: That’s a really morbid thing to say.
:+:eg:2
:>:Continue

Alright:D:Player: I’m sure it won’t come to that.
:+:EG:2


Continue:D:Jordan: But I can’t afford to not think about it.
:D:Jordan:You’re not in my house, listening to him hack and cough up a lung every night.
:D:Jordan:What if he dies in the middle of the night when Margaret and I are asleep?
:D:Jordan:What if he dies when I’m out at work, or getting groceries?
:D:Jordan:What if he gets hospitalized and dies when the doctors don’t let anyone see him?! 
:D:Player: Jordan.
:=:J:garden_angry
:?:Jordan: What?!
	You need to take a breath
	Everything’s going to be fine.:Fine

:D:Player: I know you’re stressed out, but you really ought to think about everything logically.
:D:Player: Your dad is just sick, and as much as you think he’s not doing well, or as distant as he may be, you’re still his daughter.
:D:Player:Nothing’s going to change that, not even some toxic lady who’s walked into your life. 
:=:J:garden_anxious
:D:Jordan: Then what should I do?
:D:Player: Get some PPE, take every precaution, and don’t let your dad’s girlfriend dictate how you, his own flesh and blood, can interact with your own damn father. 
:+:G:3
:>:Continue

Fine:D:Player: I know it doesn’t seem like it now, but things will get better.
:D:Player: The doctors will figure out what is wrong with your dad, and he’ll get better.
:D:Player: The important thing here is to stay as close as you can to your dad.
:D:Player: Take every precaution you can, but just be there for him. Make sure he knows you love him, and that’s all that matters. 
:=:J:garden_sad_smile
:D:Jordan: Glass half full, huh?
:D:Player: Glass half full. That’s what you need to do. 
:+:G:3

Continue:D:Jordan: I’m glad you came out here.
:=:J:garden_neutral
:D:Player: You weren’t kidding when you said the flowers here were pretty.
:D:Jordan: You know I don’t lie.
:D:Player: You really don’t.
:D:: The Player and Jordan simply stare out into the garden, watching the clouds roll through and the flowers sway in the breeze for the rest of the day.
