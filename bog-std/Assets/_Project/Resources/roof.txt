:D:Scott: Glad you decided to show up!
:D:Player: Did you invite everyone to this party?
:D:Scott: Just some friends.
:D:Player: Some? 
:?:Scott: All right, maybe a few more than I intended, but they’re all good people. There’s drinks in the kitchen, and any food in the fridge without a label is off limits. If you need me, you know where to find me.
    Being an alcoholic?
    Maybe later.:later

:D:Player: Probably enjoying a keg all to yourself.
:D:Scott: As if!
:>:Continue

:later:D:Player: I’ll find you later.
:D:Scott: You better. We still need to shotgun a beer together.
Continue:D:Player: (Thinking) Ugh I hate these late night parties. I should have just stayed home.

:?:Jordan: Over Here!! What took you so long?? I thought you were dead when you didn’t pick up your phone. 
    Unfortunately not, I'm here aren't I?
    Sorry. I was using the GPS to find this place!!:GPS

:D:Jordan: Yeah, better late than never I guess.
:+:r:1
:>:Continue

GPS:D:Jordan: Well I’m glad you found the place. Better late than never!
:+:R:1

Continue:D:Jordan: I was hoping you’d come since I know you don’t really care for these types of things, so it means a lot!
:D:Player: This is the part where you drink right?
:D:Jordan: Yup.
:D:Player: What’re you drinking? 
:?:Jordan: Something Sarah whipped up. Didn’t see what she put in it before she got me playing. Wanna take my drinks for me?
    What makes you think I’d drink for you?
    Fine.:Fine

:+:r:1
:?:Jordan: Please? 
    All right fine.
    Drink it yourself. You’re the one who lost.:Lost

:D:Jordan: Thank you. (She smiles in gratitude. Somehow, it feels like she’s using the player to test the drink for poison.) 
:D:Player: (thinking) Oh god. This is bad. Like, really bad. 
:D:Jordan: (Winks) You’re the best.
:+:R:1
:>:Continue

Lost:D:Jordan: Aw you’re no fun.
:D:Jordan:Note to self: Peach juice, vodka, and whatever the hell else is in here, does not mix well together. 
:+:r:1
:>:Continue

Fine:D:Player: Yeah sure. I’ll drink it for you.
:D:Jordan: You’re the sweetest. How is it?
:D:Player:...
:D:Jordan: Well?
:D:Player: Never let Sarah be a bartender.
:+:R:2

Continue:D:Jordan: Wanna grab some air?
:D:Player: What? I can barely hear you, it's too loud in here.
:D:Jordan: Follow me, I know a quiet place!
:D:Player: That’s better. Where are we anyways? I didn’t recognize anyone at the party.
:D:Jordan: Oh, quit trying to be funny! Did you really get tipsy from one drink? (Jordan: Side) 
:D:Player: I have a low tolerance ok?
:D:Jordan: Surely this place didn’t escape from your memories. (Jordan: Away)
:D:Player: Maybe one of Scott’s friends spiked my drink.
:D:Jordan: I think you must have smacked your head while we were climbing up here. How can you not remember this rooftop? (Jordan: Facing)
:D:Jordan: This is still my favourite part of the building. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone else up here…Remember all the late nights we used to spend staring out into the distance? (Jordan: Away)
:D:Player: It feels so long ago. I miss those nights. 
:?:Jordan: Do you think our memories mean anything? Like: what does it mean to live? Why are we here or, why do we remember things?
    What’re you talking about?
    You tell me.:Tell

:D:Player: Aren’t you a little young to be having an existential crisis?
:+:E:2
:?:Jordan: Is anyone too young to have an existential crisis? (Jordan: Side)
    Yes
    No:No

:D:Player: If they’re under the age of fifty then yeah, they are.
Jordan: Says you, how old are you anyway, eight? (Jordan: Side)
:>:Continue

No:D:Player: Maybe not. As long as they’re mature enough to think about it, then they can be any age.
:D:Jordan: Wanna join my crisis? (Jordan: Facing)
:+:E:1
:>:Continue

Tell:D:Player: How should I know the answer to that? It’s not everyday you question the reason you’re alive or whatever.
:D:Jordan: Dang, I thought you out of all people would have some insight into this. Nevermind then I guess. (Jordan: Side)
:D:Player: I just wanted your take on it, that’s all. Plus, why me out of all people?
:D:Jordan: I trust your opinion. (Jordan: Away)
:+:e:1

:D:Player: But while we’re on the subject, why not talk about the fact we’re all going to die so what does it matter if we do anything?.

:?:Jordan: Aww, it sounds like you missed me and my quasi-philosophy! (Jordan: Side)
    Not exactly
    I did.:Did

:D:Player: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
:+:e:1
:>:Continue

Did:D:Player: I just think you are an insightful person…
:+:E:1

:D:Jordan: Did you have something on your mind? (Jordan: Facing)
:D:Player: Yeah.
:D:Jordan: Can you hash that out a bit more? What exactly are you asking me?
:D:Player: I just find myself confused. I barely recognized anyone inside. These last few years have just flashed by. I feel like I don’t know where I am. I feel like I don't have a purpose... 
:D:Jordan: Maybe you should do something about it…(Jordan: Side)
:D:Player: like what? It seems like everything I do ends in failure.
:D:Jordan: Oh boo hoo. Stop being so dramatic. You need to realize you have the power to make your life what you want it to be. I don’t have everything I want, but I control what I can. (Jordan: Away)
:D:Player: Hmmm. I do have an attitude problem now that you mention it.
:?:Jordan: “Life is nothing until it is lived, it is we who give it meaning, and value is nothing more than the meaning that we give it.” 
    Seriously...?
    Impressive:Imp

:D:Player: That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. Where did you hear that nonsense?
:D:Jordan: What’s up with you tonight? When did you become a critic? (Jordan: Side)
:+:e:1
:>:Continue

Imp:D:Player: You clearly know more than I do.
:D:Jordan: Awww thanks. (Jordan: Facing)
:+:RE:1

Continue:D:Jordan: I learned that from our old pal Jean-Paul Sartre.
:D:Player: See this is what I am talking about! I don’t remember him at all…
:D:Jordan: You are way too anxious right now. Relax, he’s some old coot from France. You all right? You look like you’ve seen a ghost. (Jordan: Facing)
:D:Player: I guess I have been antsy lately. Maybe I do need to relax. Surely there’s more to life than school, work and paying off a mortgage?
:?:Jordan: You really are gloomy tonight sheesh. I think you have a purpose in life. You make me and your friends happy, that’s reason enough! (Jordan: Facing)
    I agree
    I disagree:Dis

:D:Player: When you put it that way, life does have a lot of purpose, I guess.
:D:Jordan: You guess? (Jordan: Facing)
:D:Player: I can see the value of living for other people, and it feels good having people rely on me.
:D:Jordan: Just don’t go dying out in the middle of nowhere because you think your life is an obligation to us. We’re not superheroes. Just people. (Jordan: Side)
:+:R:2
:+:E:1
:>:Continue

Dis:D:Player: That hardly seems like a purpose.
:D:Jordan: Why not? (Jordan: Side)
:D:Player: I’m not Mother Theresa, and not everyone’s got a decent enough upbringing to be entirely selfless. I can also see how it would be taxing on me if I kept doing it. I love you guys, but I need to live for me.
:+:r:2
:+:e:1

Continue:D:Jordan: Can we agree that you’re responsible for your own path in life? Including purpose? (Jordan: Away)
:D:Player: All right, fine. But what about you? Have you found your purpose in life? 
:D:Jordan: I don’t think life has purpose. (Jordan: Away)
:D:Player: What? You just asked me to agree with you about the purpose of life!
:?:Jordan: No, I asked if you would agree that you are responsible for your purpose.
    Huh?
    Go off on a tangent:Tangent

:D:Player: Do you honestly think that's true?
:D:Jordan: I’m not sure. (Jordan: Side)
:-:R:1
:+:E:1
:>:Continue

Tangent:D:Player: A lot of things that happened to me weren’t my fault! My purpose would be a lot different if I called all the shots.
:D:Jordan: … (Jordan: Side)
:+:e:1
:+:g:2

Jordan: All that I ask is you are open to the idea. (Jordan: Facing)
    I can do that.
    I don't think so.:NO

:D:Player: I’ll try and keep an open mind.
:D:Jordan: Thanks, I appreciate the effort. (Jordan: Facing)
:+:R:2
:-:g:1
:+:E:2
:>:Continue


NO:D:Player: I think I am going to pass on your French friend's ideas. I have a few of my own.
:D:Jordan: Suit yourself. (Jordan: Away)
:+:re:1

:?:Jordan: Soooo...What do you believe then? (Jordan: Side)
    I don’t know.
    It’s me against the world.:World

:D:Player: I haven't thought about it.
:D:Player: I mean I’ve toyed with the idea that there is a God, or something, up there, but then I get caught in a loop of wondering when the misery ends.
:D:Jordan: And now? (Jordan: Side)
:D:Player: Now I don’t know.
:+:R:1
:>:Continue


World:D:Player:I don’t believe in anything. Everything bad that happened in my life is someone else's fault.
:D:Jordan: That’s one way to look at it. (Jordan: Away)
:+:r:1
:+:g:3
:-:E:1

Continue:?:Jordan: I think everyone needs something to believe in. I think we’re all alone, but I find it comforting. (Jordan: Away)
    I don't understand
    That’s my problem!:problem

:D:Player: Alone? I'm right here!?
:D:Jordan: Let me rephrase.
:+:R:1
:>:Continue
