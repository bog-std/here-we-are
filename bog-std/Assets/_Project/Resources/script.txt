:D:Jordan: Took you long enough.
:D:Player: Sorry about that. 
:D:Jordan: It’s fine, it’s fine.[wait 1] I managed to grab a cup of coffee before you got here.
:?:Player: That's good.[wait 1]
	You mind if I order something?
	Need another cup? I was thinking about ordering something.::R:1
:D:Jordan: By all means.
:?:Waiter: What can I get for you today?
	Just a cup of coffee thanks.::r:1
	A cup of coffee for me, and a refill for her if you would be so kind.:Refill:R:1
:D:Jordan:And a refill for me please.
:D:Waiter:Sure thing, I'll be back with a pot.
:>:Continue
Refill:?:Waiter: Sure thing, is there anything else I can get for you at the moment?
	No that should be it.
	What's on special for today?:Special
:D:Waiter: Alright then, I'll be back with a pot.
:>:Continue
Special:?:Waiter: The potato hash is currently on special if you’re looking for something to feast on.[wait 1] Otherwise, I can suggest anything off the pastry board for something sweeter and smaller.
	I'll take the daily special, I'm feeling pretty hungry if I'm being honest.
	If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like a couple croissants with the coffee.:Croissants
	On second thought, I'll just take the coffee.:Coffee
:D:Waiter: All right one daily special. And I’ll be right back with your cup of coffee.
:D:Player: Thank you very much.
:D:Jordan: Feeling peckish, are we?
:D:Player: Always.
:D:Waiter: Here’s your order. If you need anything, just call me over.
:D:Player: You know I was going to eat that.
:D:Jordan: Hmurph hefdf.  
:D:Player: what?
:D:Jordan: (swallows) I thought we were friends.
:D:Player: Of course we are.
:?:Jordan: Then surely you’ll share some food with your friend.
	You've shared enough. Give me my food.::r:1
	You know what, take it.:TakeIt:R:1
:D:Player: Goddamn that was good.
:D:Jordan: It sure was.
:>:Continue
TakeIt:D:Jordan: You sure?
:D:Player: Yeah. You’re eating it like we’re about to go into a famine.
:D:Jordan: Well I’m glad you noticed. But if you want a couple bites or so, take it. You’re paying for this after all.
:D:Player: I know.
:>:Continue2
Croissants:D:Waiter: No trouble at all. I’ll be right back with your coffee and croissants.
:>:Continue
Coffee:D:Waiter: Sure thing. Just let me know if you change your mind.:
:D:Player: Of course.
:D:Jordan: Not hungry?
:D:Player: Just didn't want to bother them is all.
Continue:D:Waiter: Here’s your order. If you need anything, just call me over.
Continue2:?:Jordan: So how’ve you been lately?[wait 1] Feels like it’s been forever since I last saw you.
	I'm doing pretty good, all things considered. I sent out resumes and I'm hoping for a response pretty soon.::E:1
	I'm all right, I guess, I wish things were better.:Better:e:1
:D:Jordan: Still looking for a job?
:D:Player: Yeah. Something wrong with that?
:D:Jordan: No, of course not. It’s a good thing to get a job. It’s normal, y’know?
:D:Player: Yeah. Normal.
:>:Continue
Better:D:Jordan: What’s going on?
:D:Player: I’m behind on my rent this month and I haven’t had the time to properly form my resumes.
:D:Jordan: Doesn’t sound like you’re all right.
:D:Player: Like I said, I wish things were better.
Continue:D:Player: What about you? How’ve you been?
:D:Jordan: Oh, I could be better. I’m just glad to be here.
:D:Player: Aww did you miss me that much?
:?:Jordan: Y’know, I kinda did.
	Only a little bit?::r:1
	Kinda?::r:1
	I'm sorry I haven't been in touch as of late. Things have just been a rollercoaster.:Sorry:R:1
:D:Jordan: (slightly giggles to herself.) Yes, only kinda. It’s what you get for barely calling or texting.
:D:Player: I guess birthday messages have gone out of style, haven’t they?
:D:Jordan: They did. Ten years ago.
:>:Continue
Sorry:D:Jordan: Hey, don’t apologize. Life’s a complete shitstorm, so don’t worry too much about it.
:D:Player: I mean there were times I wanted to call or text, but it never felt like the right time.
:D:Jordan: Would’ve been nice to hear from you though.
Continue:D:Jordan: We should’ve chatted more. Or hung out or something.
:D:Player: Like the old days?
:?:Jordan: Yeah! God, I need a vacation.
	I feel you on that one. But we can’t stop now can we?::Er:1
	Y’know, a vacation would be really nice.:Vacation:er:1
	What you mean like the time we went to the beach?:Beach
:D:Jordan: We should though. At least, you ought to.
:D:Player: Need to get the ducks in a row before that happens now though. I can’t just up and leave my responsibilities when I’m still looking for work.
:D:Jordan: You’re right. That does sound kind of rash. Just promise me you’ll get some rest?
:D:Player: I will, once everything gets better.
:>:Continue
Vacation:D:Jordan: Right? I’d love to go to the mountains this time. Find a nice camping spot and watch the stars.
:D:Player: I’d just love to go for a drive. Put on Scott’s mixtape and just hit the road.
:D:Jordan: Scott makes mixtapes? Huh. Wild.
:>:Continue
:D:Jordan: Yeah! Exactly like that. (INSERT BEACH SCENE)
:D:Jordan: I wish we could go back to the beach.
:D:Player: The one we went to during the summer of our college years? That brings me back.
:D:Jordan: Right? It was so hot, but that day was so much fun.
:D:Player: If I recall correctly, you hated every second of that day.
:D:Jordan: Maybe so, but the fireworks off the beach were fantastic.
:D:Player: Yes, they were. Yes, they were.
Continue:D:Jordan: I wish we could go back to the good ol’ days.
:D:Player: The days when we could get away with not doing anything?
:D:Jordan: Just the better ones.
:D:Player: The days when our problems revolved around test scores and not unemployment.
:?:Jordan: Would you go back to those days?
	Of course I would. God, I had so much less fear back then. Stress I had plenty of, but not fear.::e:1
	I don’t know. I don’t think so. Probably not.:ProbablyNot:E:1
:D:Jordan: They call that ‘anxiety’ my friend.
:D:Player: I know what it’s called Jo. I just never thought I’d be in this situation.
:D:Jordan: I don’t think anyone did.
:>:Continue
:D:Jordan: Really?
:D:Player: Feels kind of immature to ignore my problems.
:D:Jordan: Not even for a day?
:D:Player: Maybe a few hours at a time, but I have responsibilities I can’t just leave alone.
:D:Jordan: Fair.
Continue:D:Jordan: I mean things should be easier, right? I’m not crazy for thinking that life shouldn’t be this hard, am I?
:D:Player: Of course not. Life is hard. But we should be able to live in it.
:D:Jordan: Good. For a while, I thought I was going crazy.
:+:Ee:1
:?:Jordan: How’re your parents?
	They’re all right.::R:1
	They were all right last time I checked.:LastTime
Jordan: Yeah?
Player: Yeah. They took a trip to the Bahamas last year and sent me lots of pictures. Seemed like a lot of
fun.
Jordan: What you didn’t go with them?
:+:R:1
