D:Jordan: Took you long enough.
D:Player: Sorry about that. 
D:Jordan: It’s fine, it’s fine.[wait 1] I managed to grab a cup of coffee before you got here.
?:Player: That's good.[wait 1]
	0:You mind if I order something?
	0:Need another cup? I was thinking about ordering something.
D:Jordan: By all means.
?:Waiter: What can I get for you today?
	0:Just a cup of coffee thanks.
	1:A cup of coffee for me, and a refill for her if you would be so kind.
D:Jordan:And a refill for me please.
D:Waiter:Sure thing, I'll be back with a pot.

?:Waiter: Sure thing, is there anything else I can get for you at the moment?:1
	0:No that should be it.
	1:What's on special for today?
D:Waiter: Alright then, I'll be back with a pot.

?:Waiter: The potato hash is currently on special if you’re looking for something to feast on.[wait 1] Otherwise, I can suggest anything off the pastry board for something sweeter and smaller.:1
	0:I'll take the daily special, I'm feeling pretty hungry if I'm being honest.
	1:If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like a couple croissants with the coffee.
	2:On second thought, I'll just take the coffee.
D:Waiter: All right one daily special. And I’ll be right back with your cup of coffee.
D:Player: Thank you very much.
D:Jordan: Feeling peckish, are we?
D:Player: Always.

D:Waiter: No trouble at all. I’ll be right back with your coffee and croissants.:1

D: Waiter: Sure thing. Just let me know if you change your mind.:2
D: Player: Of course.
D: Jordan: Not hungry?
D: Player: Just didn't want to bother them is all.
D:Waiter: Here’s your order. If you need anything, just call me over.:5
