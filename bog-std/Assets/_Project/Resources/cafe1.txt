:D:Player: I'll take the daily special, I'm feeling pretty hungry if I'm being honest.

:D:Jordan: Feeling peckish, are we?
:D:Player: Always.
:D:Waiter: Here’s your order. If you need anything, just call me over.
:D:Jordan: Oh man, that smells so good! Let me have some!

TakeIt:D:Player: You know what, take it.

	Pretty good.

:D:Player: I'm doing pretty good, all things considered. I sent out resumes and I'm hoping for a response pretty soon.
:=:J:jordan_neutral
:D:Jordan: Still looking for a job?
:D:Player: Yeah. Something wrong with that?

Better:D:Player: I'm all right, I guess, I wish things were better.

:D:Player: Aww did you miss me that much?

:?:Jordan: Y’know, I kinda did.
	Only a little bit?:Kinda
	I'm sorry...:Sorry
:D:Player: Only a little bit?
:+:r:1
:D:Jordan: (slightly giggles to herself.) Yes, only kinda. It’s what you get for barely calling or texting.
:D:Player: I guess birthday messages have gone out of style, haven’t they?
:D:Jordan: They did. Ten years ago.
:>:Continue

Sorry:D:Player: I'm sorry I haven't been in touch as of late. Things have just been a rollercoaster.
:D:Jordan: Hey, don’t apologize. Life’s a complete shitstorm, so don’t worry too much about it.
:D:Player: I mean there were times I wanted to call or text, but it never felt like the right time.
:D:Jordan: Would’ve been nice to hear from you though.
:+:R:1

Continue:D:Jordan: We should’ve chatted more. Or hung out or something.
:D:Player: Like the old days?
:?:Jordan: Yeah! God, I need a vacation.
	I feel you.
	That'd be nice.:Vacation
	Like the beach?:Beach
:D:Player: I feel you on that one. But we can’t stop now can we?
:=:J:jordan_neutral
:D:Jordan: We should though. At least, <i>you</i> ought to.
:D:Player: Need to get the ducks in a row before that happens now though. I can’t just up and leave my responsibilities when I’m still looking for work.
:D:Jordan: You’re right. That does sound kind of rash. Just promise me you’ll get some rest?
:D:Player: I will, once everything gets better.
:+:Er:1
:>:BEACH

Vacation:D:Player: Y’know, a vacation would be really nice.
:D:Jordan: Right? I’d love to go to the mountains this time. Find a nice camping spot and watch the stars.
:D:Player: I’d just love to go for a drive. Put on Scott’s mixtape and just hit the road.
:D:Jordan: Scott makes mixtapes? Huh. Wild.

:=:J:jordan_certain
:D:Jordan: Right? It was so hot, but that day was so much fun.
:D:Player: If I recall correctly, you hated every second of that day. 
:D:Jordan: Maybe so, but the fireworks off the beach were fantastic.
:D:Player: Yes, they were. Yes, they were.

# Audio Change

:D:Player: The days when we could get away with not doing anything?
:D:Jordan: Just the better ones.
:D:Player: The days when our problems revolved around test scores and not unemployment.

:?:Jordan: Would you go back to those days?
	In a heartbeat.
	I doubt it.:ProbablyNot
:D:Player: Of course I would. God, I had so much less fear back then. Stress I had plenty of, but not fear.
:=:J:jordan_certain
:D:Jordan: They call that ‘anxiety’ my friend.

Continue:D:Jordan: I mean things should be easier, right? I’m not crazy for thinking that life shouldn’t be this hard, am I?

	They’re all right.
	They were all right last time I checked.:LastTime

:?:Jordan: What you didn't go with them?
	I was busy.
	Didn't want to.:Didnt
:D:Player: I was busy with work at the time.
:D:Jordan: Work eh?

Didnt:D:Player: Didn't want to. They invited me, but I’m still chasing dreams and all that.

	To be rich.
	To be famous.:Famous
	To be happy.:Happy
:D:Player: I’ve always wanted to be rich. Like, filthy rich.
:D:Jordan: And roll around in a big money pile?
:D:Player: Have so much money that I could do whatever I want.
:D:Jordan: Like what?
:D:Player: Anything.
:+:e:1

Famous:D:Player: I'd like to try and be famous.
:D:Jordan: Then why in God’s name did you go into accounting?

:D:Jordan: Some plan.
:D:Player: Stupid plan if you ask me.

:D:Jordan: What? You haven’t called them?
:D:Player: Not since last year.
:+:r:1
:?:Jordan: Why not? They’re your parents. You should call them every once in a while, no?
	I don't like phone calls.
	Haven't gotten around to it.:Around
:D:Player: I hate being interrogated over the phone. “What’re you up to? When are you bringing someone home for Christmas?” I’d rather be hit by a car.
:=:J:jordan_angry
:D:Jordan: Be careful what you wish for. They’re your parents, and they just want to know that you’re okay. 
:D:Player: If they just listened to me, they’d know I’m all right. 
:D:Jordan: Even sitting here, I know that’s total crap. 
:D:Player: I mean, right now it’s total crap. But when I make it big, they’ll never worry about me again. And I’ll finally have my own life.

	What did you say?
	What did he say?:HeSay
:D:Player: What did you say?
:D:Jordan: I told him that I’d see that movie, and go for dinner, but as friends. I just can’t see him the same way.

HeSay:D:Player: What did he say when he asked you out?

	That's it?
	Dodged a bullet!:Glad
:D:Player: That's it?
:D:Jordan: Yup. Didn’t even open with a smooth or tacky pick-up line. Just went straight for it.
:D:Player: But could you really expect him to do anything else?
:D:Jordan: Not at all. (chuckles to herself and takes a sip of coffee.)
Glad:D:Player: I’m just glad you said no.
:D:Jordan: What do you mean by that?
:D:Player: You saw how Sarah and I turned out. Scott and I are barely hanging on to our friendship as is. 
:D:Jordan: Ah.
:D:Player: Yeah.
