Jordan: Took you long enough.
Me: Sorry about that. 
Jordan: Does it really take that long for lights to change?
Me: Probably just that one. Everyones going somewhere these days.
<<wait 2>>
Me: So howve you been lately?
? Jordan: Me? Splendidly stagnant. What about you? Still looking for work?
	> I hope not : Ive got some good ones lined up. Hoping to hear some responses within the next couple of days, or weeks, depending.
	> Yes : Yup. Still looking. 
Me: Yup. Still looking.
Jordan: Well at least you aint me. 
Me: What do you mean?
Jordan: What do you think I mean? 
Me: Something along the lines of <i>dead inside</i> or whatever. 
Jordan: Bingo.
Me: Honestly, you should lay off the coffee for a while. Your body isnt going to be happy about it.
Jordan: I can stop drinking whenever I want. And currently that means when Im dead.
Me: All right, whatever you say. 
Jordan: Ya damn right.
