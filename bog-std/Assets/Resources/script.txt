:D:Jordan: Took you long enough.
:D:Player: Sorry about that. 
:D:Jordan: It’s fine, it’s fine.[wait 1] I managed to grab a cup of coffee before you got here.
:?:Player: That's good.[wait 1]
	Mind if I order?
	Need another cup?:Another:R:1
:D:Player: You mind if I order something?
:>:Continue
Another:D:Player: Need another cup? I was thinking about ordering something.
Continue:D:Jordan: By all means.
:?:Waiter: What can I get for you today?
	A cup of coffee.::r:1
	Coffee and a refill.:Refill:R:1
:D:Player: Just a cup of coffee thanks.
:D:Jordan: And a refill for me please.
:D:Waiter: Sure thing, I'll be back with a pot.
:>:Continue
Refill:D:Player: A cup of coffee for me, and a refill for her if you would be so kind.
:?:Waiter: Sure thing, is there anything else I can get for you at the moment?
	No thanks.
	What's on special?:Special
:D:Player: No that should be it.
:D:Waiter: Alright then, I'll be back with a pot.
:>:Continue
Special:D:Player: Whats on special for today?
:?:Waiter: The potato hash is currently on special if you’re looking for something to feast on.[wait 1] Otherwise, I can suggest anything off the pastry board for something sweeter and smaller.
	I'll take the special.
	A couple croissants.:Croissants
	Just the coffee.:Coffee
:D:Player: I'll take the daily special, I'm feeling pretty hungry if I'm being honest.
:D:Waiter: All right one daily special. And I’ll be right back with your cup of coffee.
:D:Player: Thank you very much.
:D:Jordan: Feeling peckish, are we?
:D:Player: Always.
:D:Waiter: Here’s your order. If you need anything, just call me over.
:D:Player: You know I was going to eat that.
:D:Jordan: Hmurph hefdf.  
:D:Player: what?
:D:Jordan: (swallows) I thought we were friends.
:D:Player: Of course we are.
:?:Jordan: Then surely you’ll share some food with your friend.
	Give me my food.::r:1
	Take it.:TakeIt:R:1
:D:Player: You've shared enough. Give me my food.
:D:Player: Goddamn that was good.
:D:Jordan: It sure was.
:>:Continue
TakeIt:D:Player: You know what, take it.
:D:Jordan: You sure?
:D:Player: Yeah. You’re eating it like we’re about to go into a famine.
:D:Jordan: Well I’m glad you noticed. But if you want a couple bites or so, take it. You’re paying for this after all.
:D:Player: I know.
:>:Continue2
Croissants:D:Player: If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like a couple croissants with the coffee.
:D:Waiter: No trouble at all. I’ll be right back with your coffee and croissants.
:>:Continue
Coffee:D:Player: On second thought, I'll just take the coffee.
Coffee:D:Waiter: Sure thing. Just let me know if you change your mind.:
:D:Player: Of course.
:D:Jordan: Not hungry?
:D:Player: Just didn't want to bother them is all.
Continue:D:Waiter: Here’s your order. If you need anything, just call me over.
Continue2:?:Jordan: So how’ve you been lately?[wait 1] Feels like it’s been forever since I last saw you.
	Pretty good.::E:1
	I'm all right.:Better:e:1
:D:Player: I'm doing pretty good, all things considered. I sent out resumes and I'm hoping for a response pretty soon.
:D:Jordan: Still looking for a job?
:D:Player: Yeah. Something wrong with that?
:D:Jordan: No, of course not. It’s a good thing to get a job. It’s normal, y’know?
:D:Player: Yeah. Normal.
:>:Continue
Better:D:Player: I'm all right, I guess, I wish things were better.
:D:Jordan: What’s going on?
:D:Player: I’m behind on my rent this month and I haven’t had the time to properly form my resumes.
:D:Jordan: Doesn’t sound like you’re all right.
:D:Player: Like I said, I wish things were better.
Continue:D:Player: What about you? How’ve you been?
:D:Jordan: Oh, I could be better. I’m just glad to be here.
:D:Player: Aww did you miss me that much?
:?:Jordan: Y’know, I kinda did.
	Only a little bit?::r:1
	Kinda?:Kinda:r:1
	I'm sorry...:Sorry:R:1
:D:Player: Only a little bit?
:>:Skip
Kinda:D:Player: Kinda?
Skip:D:Jordan: (slightly giggles to herself.) Yes, only kinda. It’s what you get for barely calling or texting.
:D:Player: I guess birthday messages have gone out of style, haven’t they?
:D:Jordan: They did. Ten years ago.
:>:Continue
Sorry:D:Player: I'm sorry I haven't been in touch as of late. Things have just been a rollercoaster.
:D:Jordan: Hey, don’t apologize. Life’s a complete shitstorm, so don’t worry too much about it.
:D:Player: I mean there were times I wanted to call or text, but it never felt like the right time.
:D:Jordan: Would’ve been nice to hear from you though.
Continue:D:Jordan: We should’ve chatted more. Or hung out or something.
:D:Player: Like the old days?
:?:Jordan: Yeah! God, I need a vacation.
	I feel you.::Er:1
	That'd be nice.:Vacation:er:1
	Like the beach?:Beach
:D:Player: I feel you on that one. But we can’t stop now can we?
:D:Jordan: We should though. At least, you ought to.
:D:Player: Need to get the ducks in a row before that happens now though. I can’t just up and leave my responsibilities when I’m still looking for work.
:D:Jordan: You’re right. That does sound kind of rash. Just promise me you’ll get some rest?
:D:Player: I will, once everything gets better.
:>:Continue
:D:Player: Y’know, a vacation would be really nice.
Vacation:D:Jordan: Right? I’d love to go to the mountains this time. Find a nice camping spot and watch the stars.
:D:Player: I’d just love to go for a drive. Put on Scott’s mixtape and just hit the road.
:D:Jordan: Scott makes mixtapes? Huh. Wild.
:>:Continue
Beach:D:Player: What you mean like the time we went to the beach?
:D:Jordan: Yeah! Exactly like that. (INSERT BEACH SCENE)
:D:Jordan: I wish we could go back to the beach.
:D:Player: The one we went to during the summer of our college years? That brings me back.
:D:Jordan: Right? It was so hot, but that day was so much fun.
:D:Player: If I recall correctly, you hated every second of that day.
:D:Jordan: Maybe so, but the fireworks off the beach were fantastic.
:D:Player: Yes, they were. Yes, they were.
Continue:D:Jordan: I wish we could go back to the good ol’ days.
:D:Player: The days when we could get away with not doing anything?
:D:Jordan: Just the better ones.
:D:Player: The days when our problems revolved around test scores and not unemployment.
:?:Jordan: Would you go back to those days?
	Yes.::e:1
	Probably not.:ProbablyNot:E:1
:D:Player: Of course I would. God, I had so much less fear back then. Stress I had plenty of, but not fear.
:D:Jordan: They call that ‘anxiety’ my friend.
:D:Player: I know what it’s called Jo. I just never thought I’d be in this situation.
:D:Jordan: I don’t think anyone did.
:>:Continue
ProbablyNot:D: Player: I don’t know. I don’t think so. Probably not.
:D:Jordan: Really?
:D:Player: Feels kind of immature to ignore my problems.
:D:Jordan: Not even for a day?
:D:Player: Maybe a few hours at a time, but I have responsibilities I can’t just leave alone.
:D:Jordan: Fair.
Continue:D:Jordan: I mean things should be easier, right? I’m not crazy for thinking that life shouldn’t be this hard, am I?
:D:Player: Of course not. Life is hard. But we should be able to live in it.
:D:Jordan: Good. For a while, I thought I was going crazy.
:+:Ee:1
:?:Jordan: How’re your parents?
	They’re all right.::R:1
	They were all right last time I checked.:LastTime
:D:Jordan: Yeah?
:D:Player: Yeah. They took a trip to the Bahamas last year and sent me lots of pictures. Seemed like a lot of fun.
:?:Jordan: What you didn't go with them?
	I was busy.
	Didn't want to.:Didnt
:D:Player: I was busy with work at the time.
:D:Jordan: Work eh?
:D:Player: You know how busy I was trying to make ends meet. Student debt is a killer.
:D:Jordan: Your parents didn't want to help you out?
:D:Player: I didn't want them to.
:+:Re:1
:>:Continue
Didnt:D:Player: Didn't want to. They invited me, but I’m still chasing dreams and all that.
:+:re:1
:?:Jordan: And what is your dream anyways? Certainly isn’t accounting.
	To be rich.
	To be famous.:Famous
	To be happy.:Happy
:D:Player: I’ve always wanted to be rich. Like, filthy rich.
:D:Jordan: And roll around in a big money pile?
:D:Player: Have so much money that I could do whatever I want.
:D:Jordan: Like what?
:D:Player: Anything.
:+:e:1
:>:Continue
Famous:D:Player: I'd like to try and be famous.
:D:Jordan: Then why in God’s name did you go into accounting?
:D:Player: I was naïve. Tried to go into a field where I could be loaded and be famous or being rich.
:D:Jordan: Some plan.
:D:Player: Stupid plan if you ask me.
:+:e:1
:>:Continue
Happy:D:Player: I just want to be happy in life.
:D:Jordan: (Chuckles, takes a sip of coffee.) Don’t we all.
:>:Continue
LastTime:D:Player: They were all right last time I checked.
:D:Jordan: What? You haven’t called them?
:D:Player: Not since last year.
:+:r:1
:D:Jordan: Why not? They’re your parents. You should call them every once in a while, no?
